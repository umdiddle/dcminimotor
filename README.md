# DC Mini Motor

If you've ever made a mini-motor in physics class from a magnet, a battery, and a few wires, you'll know that it's not the greatest. In this project, we will be making our own version of a hand-wound motor - but one that is self-starting and capable of generating a meaningful, useable amount of power! The team will be designing a DC motor from the ground up with 3D-printed and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts.
